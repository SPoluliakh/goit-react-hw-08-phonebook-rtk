Refactor the Contact Book application code to add state management using the
Redux Toolkit library.

- Create a store with configureStore()
- Use the createSlice() function
- Create actions to save and delete a contact, as well as update the filter
- Connect React Components to Redux Logic with Hooks from the react-redux
  Library
- Use the Redux Persist library to save an array of contacts to local storage
- Add the ability to register, login and update a user, as well as work with a
  private collection of contacts to the Contact Book application.
